ChessHits
=========
ChessHits was developed for paper "Program Design & Construction" as a semester project. This project was developed by Guy Langford-Lee and Yue Li.

Implemented database feature with JDBC Derby. We know Derby is rarely used nowadays; Derby is still a good DB for practice. 

ChessHits differs the gameplay from traditional Chess. The goal is clear, to get the other king. The game gives hit points to pieces in order keep the game balance. This was my first Java project that I designed it from scratch.
