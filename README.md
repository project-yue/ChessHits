ChessHits
=========
ChessHits was developed for paper "Program Design & Construction" as a semester project. This project was developed by Guy Langford-Lee and I.

Implemented database feature with JDBC Derby. We know JDBC is rarely used nowadays; it is a good practice. ChessHits differs its gameplay from traditional Chess. The goal is clear, to get the king. The game gives hit points to pieces in order keep the game balance. This was my first Java project that I designed it from scratch.
